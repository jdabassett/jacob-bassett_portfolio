    "description": "Before I became a software engineer, I was a molecular biologist studying how proteins control gene expression. Most of my time was spent in the lab working directly with DNA, RNA, and proteins. But often I would bump into a problem that needed some custom software. As I learned to develop these small-personal programs, I became more and more drawn to programming and would want to spend the whole day playing around with code. Eventually I decided to make the switch and develop full time. I'm motivated to build tools that can make a meaningful impact in others lives. Beyond my professional work, here are some of the personal projects I have worked on during my journey.",
